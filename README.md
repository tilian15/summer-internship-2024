The report is a report of how phi3 works

the google notebook is normally a way to test Phi3 vs Llama3 but currently doesnt work because of lack of gpu (the error are detailed on the text file test llama3 vs phi3)

The text file is an operating mode on how we can test the ias and the results with 3 keys questions: 
First, we are testing with 3 questions using ollama which is a way to use those ias on our laptop.
and at the end we have the detail of notebook's errors

update 21/06 : 

We have now the phi3_test notebook who works with ssp cloud and a beginning of the demo on how the tokenizer works.
